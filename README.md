# Pure-Python-Neural-Network
Both a very simple stochastic back-propegation neural network and a batch back-propegation neural network are demonstrated in pure python, only utilizing the numpy library for matrix operations.

Both networks attempt to predict the outcome of the And gate truth table, and usually get around 90% accuracy before overfitting.

Since first starting this project, and especially now, I learnt a lot of new startagies. I may implement them in the future, but for now, I dont see a point in making more "pure python" implementaions.
