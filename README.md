# Pure-Python-Neural-Network
Both a stochastic back-propegation neural network and a batch back-propegation neural network are demonstrated in pure python, only utilizing the numpy library for matrix operations.

Both networks attempt to predict the outcome of the And gate truth table, and usually get around 90% accuracy before overfitting.
